- 👋 Hi, I’m Nguyễn Trọng Bình. Binhake is my nickname.
- 👀 I'm interested in things related to Information Technology and MMO.
- 🌱 I'm currently in high school. In my free time, I learn about computers by myself and do MMO work to earn extra income for myself.
- 💞️ I'm looking to expand my knowledge, make more friends with more experienced people with the same passion and direction as me. I hope I get what I want in the future.
- 📫 To contact me, you can see my contact information, social network address at Bio Page: http://binhake.ml/
